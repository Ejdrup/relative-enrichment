Repository method presented in the paper:
<br>
**Relative enrichment â€“ a density-based colocalization measure for single-molecule localization microscopy**

## Function description
The relative enrichment package consists of two main modules: one to compute the relative enrichment of each reference localization (RE module), and one to bin these values (bin_RE module).
<br>
Each of these modules have two main functions, with another two supporting functions for the RE module. All of them are stored in the RE_function.py file, which can be loaded as a package when stored in the current directory by calling:
<br>
**import** RE_function **as** re.
